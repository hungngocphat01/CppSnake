# CppSnake
- This is a simple Snake game written using the ``ncurses`` library in C++.
## Requirements
- A POSIX-compatible operating system (macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, etc.). Cannot run natively on Windows due to the absence of ``ncurses`` library.
- GNU gcc.`
- A terminal emulator with a minimum size of 70x20 (to ensure ASCII arts fit within the terminal's canvas).
- ``argp.h`` header file: ``argp-standalone`` Homebrew package (macOS) or gnulibc (Linux).
## How to play
- Use ``WASD`` to navigate, eat the food to grow up.
- Press ``Q`` to quit, ``P`` to pause or ``O`` to save the game.
- The snake's head cannot overlap the walls nor its body.
- If the terminal window is resized while playing, the game interface will be redrawn to fit the new size.<br>
If no constant canvas size is specified, the canvas will be the entire terminal, so it will be resized as well.
- Cheat code: ``/`` to increase the length by 1 block without having to eat any food. Only present if debug mode is enabled.
